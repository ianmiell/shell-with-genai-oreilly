First, check where we are in the filesystem:

 pwd

Then, create a folder with mkdir:

 mkdir bashin3weeks

Check the folder has this new folder in it

 ls

Move into the folder

 cd bashin3weeks

Create a file called 'first_script.sh'
Don't worry about how we create this here. We will go over all the details later.
But please remember the format, as you will need it for exercises.

 cat > first_script.sh <<EOF
 #!/bin/bash
 echo Hello world
 EOF

Check the contents of the program with cat

 cat first_script.sh

Now try and run the script as a program

 ./first_script.sh

error! it's not executable. we need to make it executable, so we use the chmod command to make it executable:

 chmod +x first_script.sh

edit the script to output the arguments

 #!/bin/bash
 echo $1

Now run it

 ./first_script.sh Hello bash

Note that spaces separate, so we can

 ./first_script.sh "Hello bash"

or edit to $1 $2

 echo $1 $2

 ./first_script.sh Hello bash

Does not throw an error if not given

 ./first_script.sh Hello

What we did:

- pwd
- mkdir
- ls
- cd
- cat (to show and create files)
- chmod to make file executable
- running a script in a local folder
- script arguments
