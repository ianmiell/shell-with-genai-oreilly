CSV Summation

- Write a script 'csv_sum.sh' that takes the path to a simple CSV file as an argument (assume each row has numbers in one column).

- The script calculates the sum of all numbers in that column and prints it to the screen.

- If the file doesnâ€™t exist or is empty, print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.
