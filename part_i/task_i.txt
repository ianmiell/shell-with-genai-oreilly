Hello, Arguments!

- Write a script 'hello.sh' that takes exactly one argument (e.g., a name).

- If the user provides the argument, the script should greet them by name, for example:

  ./hello.sh Bob
  Hello, Bob!

- If the user does not provide exactly one argument, the script should print a usage* message, such as:

  Usage: ./hello.sh <name>
