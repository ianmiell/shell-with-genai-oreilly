File or folder checker

- Write a script 'check_path.sh' that takes one argument: a path (file or directory).

- The script should check whether the path exists, whether itâ€™s a file or a directory, and display an appropriate message.

- Bonus: Return different exit codes for each scenario, e.g.,
  - 0 if it's a file,
  - 1 if it's a directory,
  - 2 if it does not exist.
