Log Filter

- Write a script 'filter_logs.sh' that:

  - Reads from a log file (passed as the first argument).

  - Filters out lines containing a specified keyword (second argument).

  - Sorts the matching lines and removes duplicates.

  - Writes the final output to stdout while capturing any errors (eg 'file not found') to 'error.log'.

- Include a brief usage message if any arguments are missing.
