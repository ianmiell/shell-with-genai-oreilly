Maths Functions

- Write a script 'math_functions.sh' that defines:

  - A function 'add_numbers' that accepts two parameters and echoes their sum.

  - A function 'multiply_numbers' that accepts two parameters and echoes their product.

- In the main script:

  - Call each function with different pairs of numbers.

  - Capture and display the results with descriptive messages like "The sum of 5 and 3 is 8."

- If either function is called with fewer or more than two parameters, print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.
