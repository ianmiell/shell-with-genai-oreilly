Manage Text

- Write a script 'manage_text.sh' that:

   - Reads a large text file from stdin (eg 'cat bigfile.txt | ./manage_text.sh').

   - Uses 'awk' or 'grep' to filter lines based on a pattern.

   - Passes the filtered lines to 'sort'.

   - Pipes the sorted lines to 'uniq' to remove duplicates.

   - Redirects the final result to 'output.txt'.

- Print a summary line at the end:

   "Done filtering! The cleaned-up text is in 'output.txt'."
