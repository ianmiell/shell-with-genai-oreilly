Grep and Sed for Log Analysis

- Create a script `regex_logs.sh` that:

  - Reads a list of log filenames from stdin (eg via 'cat loglist.txt | ./regex_logs.sh').

  - For each log file, searches for IP addresses using a regex

  - Extracts these IP addresses and rewrites them to a file 'extracted_ips.log'.

- Use 'sed' or 'awk' to mask part of each IP address (eg `192.168.xxx.xxx`) for privacy.

- Print a summary of how many unique IPs were found per file.
