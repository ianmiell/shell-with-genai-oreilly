System Status Reporter

- Write a script `system_report.sh` that:

  - Prints disk usage

  - Prints memory usage

  - Prints the current system uptime and load average

  - Lists the top 5 CPU-consuming processes

- Use a for loop or multiple commands in sequence to gather this information, then summarize it in a neat, readable format.
