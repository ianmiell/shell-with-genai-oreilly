Find and Process Large Files (Optional Advanced Task)

- Write a script 'large_files.sh' that:

   - Uses 'find' to locate files over 100MB in the '/var/log' directory (or another directory if you prefer).

   - Prints the file list to stdout and writes the same list to 'large_files.txt'.

   - For each large file, prompt the user if they want to compress it.

- Use `xargs` to compress multiple files in one go
